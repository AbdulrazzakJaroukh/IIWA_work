In this Repo, some functionalities using Manipulator IIWA are written in C++/Py codes/scripts.

* iiwa-forward-kinematic contains C++ code that reads multiple configurations for IIWA as joints values from csv file which must be localized in Input forlder and returns the cartesian coordinates of IIWA end effector as a csv file located in Output folder.
* Drawing folder has two python scripts each creates a trajectory/sampling animation of the data in Output folder.
